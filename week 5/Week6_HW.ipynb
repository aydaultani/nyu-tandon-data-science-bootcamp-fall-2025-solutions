    "For this I will use an 80/10/10 split. Each person will have their own split to make sure I can measure true generalization to new speakers. To prevent skewing I also plan to match the phone distribution across splits at the speaker level. The mode is trained on 80 speakers, tuned on 10 and evaluated on another 10. This will give a good measure of if the model can generalize to new voices or not.\n",
